To use D365FO services, they must be registered with the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for cloud installation and AD FS for on-premises installation.

**To register a service with the Azure AD, follow these steps:**
1. Go to the **Azure Active Directory** tab of the Azure portal.
2. Select Properties and note the tenant ID in the Directory ID field. You will need the tenant ID later to retrieve an Azure AD authentication token.
3. On the Azure Active Directory tab, select **App registrations.**
4. Select **New application registration.**
5. Enter a name that identifies the external application that you're registering. For an application that will authenticate by using a shared secret, select **Web app / API.**
6. Select the new application and copy the application ID.
7. Select **Required permissions.**
8. Select Add.
9. Choose Select an API.
10. Select **Microsoft Dynamics ERP** (Microsoft.ERP).
11. Under Delegated permissions, you must select, at a minimum, the following options:
    * **Access Dynamics AX Custom Service**
    * **Access Dynamics AX data**
    * **Access Dynamics AX online as organization users**
12. Select Done.
13. Select Keys.
14. In the dialog box that appears, enter a description, and then set the Expires value to Never expires.
15. Select Save.
